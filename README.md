# Project_Plotting_matplotlib_histograms_boxplot_assignment-

The most recent ASC23 considered four major systems-based tracks with a view to providing region-focused contributions to inform the global stocktake among them Cities, urban and rural settlements, infrastructure, and transport.
In this assignment, I will be performing analysis more specifically on transport (vehicles and fuel efficiency).
The dataset has been provided.
I am going to make sense of the data that will later be used for AI purposes.

in the first section I'll work with the fuel economy dataset.
I will load the dataset and print at least 10 rows.
Next I will create a histogram that depicts the distribution of carbon Dioxide.
I will also create a heatmap of the data.
